## Agile Methodology
An Agile Approach was used to develop this site. This was achieved by breaking the project down into smaller tasks.
To complete the overall aim of the website, 21 issues were created as specific tasks called User Stories. These User Stories are small sections of the project designed to accomplish a specific goal. Once the User Story was working effectively it was moved across the Kanban board, in the following working order. 
+ To do
+ In Progress
+ Done

All my user stories were completed and succesfully actioned. The design was based on the Agile Methodology.
