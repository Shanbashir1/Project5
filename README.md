## Agile Methodology
An Agile Approach was used to develop this site. This was achieved by breaking the project down into smaller tasks.
To complete the overall aim of the website, 21 issues were created as specific tasks called User Stories. These User Stories are small sections of the project designed to accomplish a specific goal. Once the User Story was working effectively it was moved across the Kanban board, in the following working order. 
+ To do
+ In Progress
+ Done

<img src="docs/readme-images/user-stories.png" alt = "Prestige|Watches" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;">

All my user stories were completed and succesfully actioned. The design was based on the Agile Methodology.


 My Projects and User Stories can be viewed here :  [Issues and Projects](https://github.com/users/Shanbashir1/projects/6/views/1 "Github Issues")


 ## Wireframes

## Future Features
While creating the Project, I realised that the vast input I could add to the design to allow it to have more functionalities. As we have all learnt the timescope involved limits the overall scope.

What I could possibily add as a Future Feature? 

1. Add more variety of products and create better categories for user to apply its search facilities. 
2. Better products layout, with the limited time scope I was not abel to cut the images to the correct length, which resulted in the images being slighly off design and scope. However with limited time and resources the images would be much more user friendly. 
3. User being able to add comments and reviews on the products page .
4. Generally so much to add, to make the site much more efficient and user friendly. 

## Web Marketing 

### Social Media
+ A facebook page was created to build community from the target market. Facebook is free and it also takes little to no time to set up and also it has so many users whom a business can strive to maintain a certain relationship, create content and connect with a target audience. 

<img src="docs/readme-images/facebook.png" alt = "Facebook page" style="height:300px; width: 100%;">

### Search engine optimization
+ Keywords SEO are important for search engines to pick up keywords while users are searching online. 
+ Below are some of the keywords I have used for the site 

<img src="docs/readme-images/seo.png" alt = "SEO" style="height:200px; width: 100%;">

#### Sitemap.xml 
+ A sitemap file with a list of important URLs was added to ensure that search engines are able to easily navigate through the site and understand its structure. This was made using XML-sitemaps.com by following the steps:
1. Paste the URL of the deployed site into XML-sitemaps
2. Download the XML sitemap file
3. Add the file into the projects root folder, named as sitemap.xml

#### Robots.txt
A robots.txt file was created to tell search engines where not to go on the website and increase the quality of the site, ultimately improving the SEO rating.

### Mailchimp Email Marketing
+ Users can subscribe to newsletters by entering their email address.
+ Email Marketing can alert users to special offers and important information. 

## Testing

### Inside your Terminal and Workspace 
+ Inside your terminal install the following, using the below commands. 
```
  pip3 install boto3
  pip3 install django-storages 
```

+ Freeze the requirements.txt file by using the following command 
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

+ Add "storages" to your installed apps within your settings.py file.
+ At the bottom of the settings.py file add the following code:
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
```

+ Add the following keys within your Heroku Settings Convig Vars: 
```
"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" and "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY". These can be found in your CSV file.
```

+ Add the key "USE_AWS", and set the value to True within Heroku.
Remove the "DISABLE_COLLECTSTAIC" variable from Heroku.

+ Within your settings.py file inside the code just written add:
```  
AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f"{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com"
Inside the settings.py file inside the bucket config if statement add the following lines of code:
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

+ In the root directory of your project create a file called "custom_storages.py". Import the following at the top of this file and add the classes below:
```
  from django.conf import settings
  from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

  class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

  class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION

```

+ Navigate back to you AWS S3 Bucket and click on "Create Folder" name this folder "media", within the media file click "Upload > Add Files" and select the images for your site.
+ Under "Permissions" select the option "Grant public-read access" and click "Upload".

## Stripe
Stripe is a online payment system to allow online payments, using credit/debit cards. Store owners will need to register for a stripe account, in order to use it's services. To register with stripe you can visit their site [via this link -- STRIPE](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)

+ The site contains lots of useful documentation and codes to get you started up, once registered you will be able to easily set up test payments and use a developer account to test payments etc. 

### Webhooks 
1. To set up a webhook, sign into your stripe account and click 'Developers' located in the top right of the navbar.

2. Then in the side-nav under the Developers title, click on "Webhooks", then "Add endpoint".

3. On the next page you will need to input the link to your heroku app followed by /checkout/wh/. It should look something like this:

    ```
    https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
    ```
4. Then click "+ Select events" and check the "Select all events" checkbox at the top before clicking "Add events" at the bottom. Once this is done finish the form by clicking "Add endpoint".

5. Your webhook is now created and you should see that it has generated a secret key. You will need this to add to your heroku config vars.

6. On your Heroku app navigate to the config vars section under settings. You will need the secret key you have just generated for your webhook, in addition to your Publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section back in stripe.

Add these values under these keys:

    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'

    Finally, back in your settings.py file in django, insert the following near the bottom of the file:

    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
    ```


+ Below is successful working webhook response page.
